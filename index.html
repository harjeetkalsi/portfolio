    <h1><q>I am an aspiring web developer </q>, looking for work!</h1>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.wandzilakwebdesign.com/philosophy-of-web-design-and-development/">
        <p>We believe that a website is a powerful entity capable of representing an idea, a person, a company, a service or a product.

            Being that a website has such potential, in order to design such an advanced system, sometimes it becomes beneficial to look at it from a psychological perspective.
            
            After all, a web presence is always intended to engage a personâ€™s psyche and ultimately excite them to confidently invest their time or hard earned dollars.</p>
